The great ice fields and blue glaciers of the Sanctuary Wall lie below. Annapurna I, highest of all is beyond, and around, in an arc from horizon to horizon, from Dhaulagiri to the Mustang, are a dozen or more glistening snow- bound giants. Standing on a spot that has been constant aim for days now. A place, a time, a view that is almost impossible to equal –and earned it. Whatever achievement, by 1:00pm and back trip to camp." },

Although remote and still away from the much-used ‘Tea – house’ trekking routes, our expedition now takes on the moods of the warm valley and the friendly villages. Here, we make our way along the banks of the Mardi Khola from the hill – side village or siding, down through the lovely fields, past the simple farms and over the interesting bridges. There is no doubting this is indeed the idyllic Nepali countryside." },
